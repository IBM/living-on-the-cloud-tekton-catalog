# Living on the Cloud Tekton

This repository contains files for defining reusable tekton elements, the building blocks that will be added to a pipeline. In an enterprise setting an organizations would likely prefer to place generic and reusable tekton elements, for example defining how to build a Java application, in a central location. This will reduce code duplication, and also allow easy sharing of updates and fixes as a change would only have to be made in one location.
